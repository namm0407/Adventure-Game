In a world consumed by darkness and despair, tragedy befalls your beloved. 
Your boyfriend, captured by the most evil demon known to mankind, awaits your rescue. 
It is now your destiny to embark on an extradinary journey to rescue him!

Prepare yourself, for your journey begins within a mysterious jungle, concealing deadly bombs beneath its surface. 
Navigate the jungle, avoiding hidden bombs while collecting one of your own as a powerful weapon against the demon. 

But the jungle is merely the first trial on your path.

Only then can you unleash water's power while preparing it to flood the demon's castle. 

But the demon has one final test in store for you, a test of wisdom. 
Your task is to answer a seris of questions, each more difficult than the last. 

With each step, you shall grow in strength and prowess. 
This journey is not for the faint-hearted, but your determination will guide you through the darkest of times. 
In the end, only the strongest and smartest warrior can hope to pass this impossible mission. 

Now, warrior, I ask you once again: Are you truly prepared to embark on this perilous journey?
